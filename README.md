Banking app created during CODE:ME course using MERN stack
(Mongodb, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

The main tech stack is called "MERN". This stands for Mongo,
Express, React, Node. There's a middleware written in
express.js - a simple REST API. I am using it to authorize
users and also collect all their data. React with
react-router provides a single-page user experience. It has
minimalistic CSS and HTML. The database which I am using is
free and non-relative MongoDB with an external cloud
cluster.

Features:

-   REST Api
-   React router
-   React Hooks
    -   State
    -   Context
    -   Effect
    -   Cusotm
-   Cloud and non-relative Database (Mongo)
-   Responsive Web Design

The user can create his own account which is stored in the
database. After logging in, it is possible to check the
account balance and send a transfer for a specific user and
credit card management. Personalization settings contains
theme changer - "dark" or "light".
