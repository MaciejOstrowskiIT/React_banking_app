Banking app created during CODE:ME course using MERN stack
(Mongodb, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

TODO list:

-   CSS with responsive design
-   NEW layout (just for a good view to user)
-   Server Cookies - to authorise users more safely
-   Transaction history (almost done)
-   Last login (almost done)
-   ... and few more ;)


The main tech stack is called "MERN". This stands for Mongo, Express, React, Node. There's a middleware written in express.js - a simple REST API. I am using it to authorize users and also collect all their data. 
React with react-router provides a single-page user experience. It has minimalistic CSS and HTML. 
The database which I am using is free and non-relative MongoDB with an external cloud cluster.
